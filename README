A bot for the bejeweled blitz game on Facebook.

This is the result of a private hack session with the aim of creating a bot as fast as possible without using any library except the windows API itself. Once the bot has determined where the bejeweled flash object is located (semi-manual process) you can make it go a single step on demand or let it go on a specified timer.

There are a thousand bots out there, the only slightly interesting thing about this bot is that it shows a copy of the screen that it grabbed. It shows how it 'parsed' the information. If there are a lot of explosions one can see 'misses' in colour detection. It also shows all the moves it can and will make. This visual aid seems like redundant work but actually became a great timesaver during debugging.

The code is definitely not industry-strength. (It always surprises me how much more work coding properly really is..) I've put it on Github just in case it might serve to help or inspire someone else.
